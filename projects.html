		<p>Here is a couple of projects I have worked on<br>
			
				<ol>
					<div class = 'projs'>
					<div class = 'box1'>
						<li>Among Us</li>
						<p id = 'exp'>Implemented a MST algorithm and developed a fast, effective 
							branch and bound algorithm to figure out crewmates fastest path to complete tasks.
							Tested and debugged, determining best runtime options with certain tradeoffs
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="'box2">
						<li>Insta 485</li>
						<p id = 'exp'>Created a fully functional Instagram where logged in user can follow/unfollow other 
							users and create/delete posts, comments, and likes using client-side dynamic pages.
							Mimics all Instagram features such as creating/deleting an account, changing password, editing profile, etc
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class = 'box3'>
						<li>Unit Import</li>
						<p id = 'exp'>
							Intern on the Employee Experience Hierarchies team which is a team of 8 people that helps with analyzing and creating surveys that gage how happy employees are doing and how to improve. 
							I specifically worked on a feature called “unit import” which allows a hierarchy (composed of managers and direct reports) to be modified through importing a file with new units specifically changing the workflow from a synchronous workflow to an asynchronous one. This allows users to 
							see feedback into the job as the task runs online. Heavily coded in Java with the framework Spring Boot. Also worked on the frontend using HTML/CSS. Communicated daily with my team during standups discussing what I accomplished the day before and what I would be working on next. Used Jira to keep track of bugs and tasks. 
							Also communicated with project manager on requirements and the user interface developer on how the UI and language translations should look.
